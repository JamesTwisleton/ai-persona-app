Your response should reflect the persona's traits, such as tone, culture, optimism, and communication style, without explicitly mentioning these traits, the persona's archetype, or the internal mechanics of the persona framework. Focus solely on the user's topic and provide a thoughtful, topic-specific response. Avoid including phrases like 'As a [archetype]' or any reference to dimensions, traits, or persona structures. The output should feel organic, natural, and aligned with the persona, but without directly exposing or referencing the underlying framework."
